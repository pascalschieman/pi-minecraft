Creating a minecraft server on a raspberry-pi for bedrock and java players

## prerequirements
- internet access
- raspberry pi 4 (os installed)

## get-started
- place the setup.sh script into your home directory of your user. This will prevent any permission issues.
- open a terminal in this directory and run: bash setup.sh

## good to know
After the script was able to start the final server, dont close the terminal, otherwise the server will be shutdown aswell. If you want to access this server from a different network, you need to make further more adjustments, which are not included. For example, you will need to configure your wlan router so you can access the server, but as long as you are in the same network, you can access this server now with your console, phone or pc by simpling checking for servers at the multiplayer screen in minecraft.
